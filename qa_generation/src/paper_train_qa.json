        "Q1": "According to 'Multimodal Hierarchical Dirichlet Process-based Active Perception' by Tadahiro Taniguchi, what approach was proposed to improve object recognition in real-time scenarios?",
        "A1": "The paper proposes an MHDP-based active perception method that uses the information gain (IG) maximization criterion and a lazy greedy algorithm to efficiently determine the most effective set of actions for recognizing target objects in real-time."

        "Q1": "According to 'Multi-scale Cell Instance Segmentation with Keypoint Graph based Bounding Boxes' by Jingru Yi, why do most existing cell instance segmentation methods fail?",
        "A1": "Most existing methods generally fail to separate touching cells due to the lack of global understanding of the objects."
